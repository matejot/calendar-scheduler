# calendar-scheduler
final project for the ironhack bootcamp
will add more content as ideas surface
for starters the idea is as follows
There will be 3 different sites/locations
Each site will have 5 employees
Each employee will go on a shift rotation 
Rotations are as follows: 2 Mornings, 2 Evenings, 2 Nights, 4 days off
There needs to be a calendar mechanic as well as days of the week

in case an employee from 1 site is off for various reasons(holiday, sick elave etc) need to cross check among all 3 sites whos available to cover
